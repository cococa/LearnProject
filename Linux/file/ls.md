# ls


## The ls command lets you see the files and directories inside a specific directory (current working directory by default). It normally lists the files and directories in ascending alphabetical order.


### 
ls
ls [Directory_Path]



###  
-l  Show results in long format
-h  like -l but displays file size in human-readable unit not in bytes
-a  Show all files, including hidden files (file names which begin with a period .)
-d  Instead of listing the files and directories inside the directory, it shows any information about the directory itself, it can be used with -l to show long formatted information
